# Data Wrangling Project
> The purpose of this project was to display my skills I developed here at Tippie in R-Studio. My group and I wanted to analyze how Movie ratings correlated with earnings overtime. Throughout this project we look at multiple different aspects that dive into that relationship. 

Our group wanted to analyze how ratings and earnings are correlated for movies. We wanted to showcase the skills we developed in R Studio at the Unversity of Iowa - Tippie College of Business.
